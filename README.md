# Photo mosaic

This openFrameworks application generates [photo mosaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic). Specify a target image ("outer image") and a directory of candidate images and the program will assign all the candidate images to a tile in the mosaic. All candidates are assigned exactly once with none missing and no duplicates. Thus the following [samples](https://www.flickr.com/photos/genekogan/albums/72157666460255840) are all made of exactly the same tiles, which is the animals categories of the [Caltech-256](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/images/) dataset. Samples:
